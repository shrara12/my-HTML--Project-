<p >My first impression of Cairo was that it was interchangeable with any city in
India. Crowds of people everywhere, honking traffic, brightly lit shops with
everything from wind-up toy soldiers and tacky souvenirs to pyjamas and
vegetables stacked on wooden tables spilling onto the pavements. And everything
covered with a thin film of dust. The dust was everywhere there was no escaping
it for the entire time I was in Egypt � pretty much as it had been while
growing up in India. You have to make your peace with the dust. The sandy bedrock
of the city bursts through cracks in the pavements then gets teased and whipped
into clouds by the hot breeze. When you return home and wipe your face with a
pad of cotton wool it turns completely black like with soot!</p>

<p>The haze of dust that covers the city is most noticeable when you climb the Citadel
of Cairo and look over the urban sprawl. Once you climb the winding pavements
of the fortified citadel built by Saladin around 1180 A.D, at the summit you
come upon the imposing Mosque of Muhammad Ali. Its sheer size is hard to convey
in words. It was built in the Ottoman style � a low flat body topped by bulbous
silver domes and surrounded by tall slender minarets in all corners. As you
enter the first thing you notice is a curious low-lying chandelier-like
structure with glass lamps hanging down in concentric circles and bathing the
interior with a dull gold glow. The interiors of the immense domes also look
like they are covered in burnished gold with intricate detailing in green. On
all four corners are circles painted green and covered with gold stylised Arabic
scripts, not unlike the names of the apostles carved around Christian basilicas.</p>



<p >This was my first introduction to Islamic design and architecture. The emphasis
seems to be in the intense intricacy of details. As you look closer you notice
a profusion of different styles � geometric, floral, interspersed with flowing
scripts. Using different coloured marbles and inlaid gold the designs often
cause a sort of optical illusion as you walk past.</p>
