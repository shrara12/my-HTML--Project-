<p >Egypt Travel Diary Part 4: Sailing down the Nile</p>

<p >Most  organised tours at this point take you on a Felucca cruise down the Nile from
Aswan towards Luxor. This is a lovely little break from tramping around in the
sun. The Felucca is a flat barge with mattresses on the floor and a cloth
awning overhead which provides a welcome shade from the beating sun. It slowly
makes its way down the legendary river and you get the blessed opportunity to
take naps, chat with your fellow travellers, read, write or do absolutely
nothing but stare out into space. After a brief stop to picnic on the banks,
you spend the night on the Felucca under the startling black of the night sky
as the rhythmic lapping waters of the river lull you into a peaceful sleep.</p>
