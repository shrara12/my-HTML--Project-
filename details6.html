 <p>Egypt Travel Diary Part 6:Valley of the Kings</p>

<p >On the way to the Valley of the Kings, we stopped by Queen Hatshepsut�s mortuary
temple that is carved into a sheer rock face. It is some way back from the main
road and I remember being absolutely baked to a crisp as I trudged across the
flat land in the harsh blaze of the relentless sun. Our guide helpfully told us
this was one of the hottest places on the face of the earth (actual recorded
fact). I believed him.</p>

<p >The temple is a curious structure literally carved as I mentioned into a sheer side
of a rocky cliff. It is made up of three horizontal collonaded terraces layered
atop each other with a long sloping ramp connecting them. Back in the day, the
terraces used to be covered with gardens made fragrant by exotic trees and
shrubs like myrrh and frankincense. One of the ceilings of the temple is
painted blue with gold stars across it and a row of gold snakes around the
edges. At the corners are eagles with elaborately feathered outstretched wings
painted in the colours red, white and blue!</p>



<p >Scattered across the surrounding hillsides we noticed little openings which our guide
explained rather morbidly were the mouths of burial caves which served as group
tombs � cemeteries carved into the rocks if you will.</p>

<p >Apparently the only way to proceed to the Valley of the Kings is by riding on mules. They
were fairly well trained and didn�t become skittish even as we trotted them
down highways with noisy trucks rattling past us.</p>

<p >Unfortunately you are not allowed to take photographs in or around the Valley. It is a dusty,
mountainous terrain and it must have been by sheer accident or the passing down
of folk tales from generation to generation that grave robbers and later archaeologists
discovered the tombs of the kings that were so carefully hidden amongst the
rocks of this Valley. I remember lining up in long queues at the entrances of
the various tombs and shuffling through the underground chambers.</p>

<p >The interiors were well preserved though of course bereft by now of the riches and
treasures they must have once held. The walls were painted white and covered
with colourful depictions of the Pharaoh. These paintings offered a detailed
insight into the funerary rituals and beliefs about the afterlife that formed
such an important part of the Egyptian civilisation. For e.g. there were
paintings showing the path to the Afterlife which Egyptians believed consisted
of passing through multiple portals or chambers, each of which was guarded by
an evil looking supernatural being that was part animal. Helpfully there were
spells inscribed underneath these paintings that would help the deceased get
past these monsters. After which came the Judgement where the God Osiris
weighed the deceased�s heart on a pair of scales against a feather. If the
heart was as light as the feather and hence bereft of the heaviness of sin, the
deceased was permitted passage into the afterlife �&nbsp; a utopian land lush
and fertile and aptly named the Field of Reeds. There were also paintings of
the deceased�s eventual ascension to the sky and his passage across the heavens
on the Sun God Ra�s chariot. However if the heart proved heavier than the
feather there was a rather vicious looking beast that was part crocodile standing
by to devour the unfortunate sinner.</p>
