                <p c>Egypt  Travel Diary Part 3:&nbsp;Abu Simbel</p>

                <p >I have to give a special mention here to the train journey we took from Cairo to
                Aswan. The trains were absolutely filthy with mice darting around the corridors
                and seats that looked like roaches might crawl out of the tears in the
                cushions. Luckily we had some interesting company to keep us distracted. There
                were a couple of hippieish American girls sharing our compartment � all dreadlocked
                hair, harem pants and beaded bracelets. They turned out to be volunteers with
                the Peace Corps who had been living in some obscure African village for the
                past few months. They were refreshingly honest when they spoke about their
                experience and didn�t try to romanticise the privations of living in a
                primitive environment worlds away from the comforts of their hometowns. One of
                them recounted with a chuckle how ecstatic she had been when a care package
                sent by her mother arrived with chocolates. The chocolates had melted in the
                heat of the journey yet she licked the packet clean saying it was the happiest
                she had ever felt in her whole life.</p>
                
                <p >The
                temples of Abu Simbel were I think the highlight of my trip to Egypt. There was
                something so dramatic about these temples carved into the face of sandy cliffs
                with the desert stretching out behind and the brilliant blue waters of Lake
                Nasser in front. At the entrance to the temple are four giant seated statues of
                Ramesses II. With their eyes closed, their faces calm and expressionless, their
                palms facing downwards and resting on their knees, they have towered over
                millions of visitors who have walked past them humbled and in awe for
                centuries. There are smaller figures standing between their legs which represent
                Queen Nefertiti and their children.</p>
                
                <p >What
                is apparent as you visit various sites of the Egyptian civilisation is the
                sheer narcissism and megalomania of its rulers. They wanted to leave behind as
                many giant God-like statues of their likeness as they possibly could all over
                their lands to ensure their legends would live on in posterity. And they
                certainly succeeded.</p>
                
                <p >Our
                guide told us an interesting anecdote. Apparently, the temples are not at their
                original site. The construction of a dam on the River Nile threatened the
                submergence of these ancient marvels and it was only by the heroic efforts of
                archaeologists and engineers funded by voluntary donations from around the
                world under the aegis of UNESCO that they were carefully dismantled, lifted and
                relocated onto a higher ground further back from the rising waters of the
                reservoir.</p>
                
                <p >Inside
                the temples are more statues and carved pillars, the walls are covered from
                floor to ceiling with reliefs depicting battle scenes and military victories.
                The interior is quite dark, and a quirky feature of how the temples are built
                is that on two particular days of the year the rays of the sun penetrate right through
                the interior to light up the sculptures on the back wall. No one is sure of the
                significance of these two days. A popular theory is perhaps one of the dates
                was the King�s birthday and the other the day of his ascension to the throne.</p>
                
                
                
                <p >Egyptians
                painstakingly covered every possible inch of their temples and tombs and other monuments
                with incredibly detailed carved reliefs depicting their times and mythologies
                often accompanied by reams and reams of explanatory hieroglyphics. These are a
                wonderful window into their world and you can�t help but feel gratitude even
                though you know the human cost of these works. Imagine the thousands of poor
                slave labourers who must have toiled in the relentless heat for hours every day
                to produce these. Some would have balanced themselves on tall ladders or
                scaffolding all day to carve at the tops of walls and pillars with the only
                relief possible when they simply fell off in exhaustion and died.</p>
                
                <p >There
                are recurring themes in Egyptian carvings. Like the unmistakeable figures of
                Pharaohs and Gods. Their figures are always taller and bigger than the rest and
                distinguishable by their elaborate head-gear. The Gods are often seen passing
                talismans to the Kings indicating divine blessing for them to assume the throne
                as well as the promise of protection against their enemies. After a while you
                start recognising the Gods. There is Isis with a giant solar disk on her head
                supported by carved horns on the sides. There is the sky god Horus with a
                falcon�s head and Anubis with a jackal�s head who is the God overseeing
                funereal rites.</p>
                
                <p >The
                reliefs often show smaller �normal� people lining up in front of the Gods with
                offerings of fruits and vegetables on platters, or amphora filled with wine.
                Then there&nbsp;are depictions of Pharaohs sailing on military barges or
                standing tall and smiting huddled Lilliputian masses of some enemy army
                cowering at their feet. There are elaborate carvings of flora and fauna. Some
                of the more curious ones being baboons raising their arms in supplication and
                queuing up in front of a God or King, eagles with outstretched wings carved
                over doorways and the much-mythicised scarabs (sacred beetles).</p>
                
                <p >Often
                there are mutant creatures for e.g. one with the head of a falcon and the body
                of a Jackal and of course the Sphinx. The women featured in the carvings often
                wear some sort of chain-mail like wig and elaborate necklaces not unlike Liz
                Taylor in the movie. But they are usually completely naked or wearing a simple sarong-like
                skirt, unlike her flowing silk gowns. The pillars have papyrus leaf designs
                carved at the top but if you notice closely no two pillars� leaves will be
                exactly the same, a quiet nod to the&nbsp;inexhaustible variety that exists in
                nature.</p>
