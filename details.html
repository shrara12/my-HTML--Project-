alt="Egypt Travel Diary – Land of the Pharaohs"/>

   
          <p >While  the Pyramids of Giza hog the limelight being the last Wonder of the Ancient
             World to survive, far more spectacular monuments awaited me in Abu Simbel,
             Luxor and the Valley of the Kings.</p>
                
                <p >Think about all the things that have happened in the world since Cleopatra decided to
                shuffle off this mortal coil with a stab from her pet asp thus bringing to an
                end the Age of the Pharaohs. The Fall of the Roman Empire, the Crusades, the
                Henrys I to VIII, the Russian Revolution, the two World Wars, the Moon landing,
                the Cold War, 9/11, Star Wars Episodes I to VII, the rise of Apple, YouTube,
                the Kardashians�.</p>
                
                <p >Now what if I told you the Age of the Pharaohs lasted as long and in fact a little
                longer than all of the time that has past since! It was such an extraordinarily
                rich, complex and advanced civilisation of the kind the world has never seen
                since. Its monuments still stand silent and enigmatic and so utterly alien
                amidst the modern chaos of the country Egypt is today. Visiting these monuments
                felt nothing short of a pilgrimage to me.</p>
                
                <p>I went to Egypt in October 2010 a few months before the Arab Spring. I never felt
                unsafe or threatened but I do have to mention the constant nuisance of men
                coming up and trying to talk to me as I was walking down streets or through
                markets. It wasn�t really eve-teasing, more of an annoyance than anything.
                Sometimes they try and get you to enter their souvenir shop or try their
                restaurant. Sometimes they foist unwanted advice and directions if you are
                looking remotely lost and then try to charge a fee for it. After a while the
                relentless hassle gets on your nerves, the smile on your face feels more and
                more strained and you resist the urge to scream and run. Often they would try
                and guess my nationality as a way of starting up a conversation. And because a
                few guessed I was Indian a constant refrain was �Shah Rukh Khan? Shah Rukh Khan?�
                Shah Rukh Khan is one of the biggest stars in the Indian film industry and
                clearly a bit of a cultural icon in these parts of the world as well. I didn�t
                really know what they expected me to say �Yes I�ve heard of him, yes I think
                he�s great, no I don�t know him personally?!�</p>
                
                <p >I felt it wasn�t safe encouraging a conversation so I would just shake my head
                and walk on and that would be that. Luckily for most of the tour, I was part of
                a larger group and accompanied by a local man as a guide who shepherded us
                around and shooed these pests away. I would definitely recommend doing the same
                so you can focus your energies on marvelling at the sights. But if that is not
                possible I still wouldn�t be dissuaded for this reason from visiting Egypt. As
                a matter of fact I explored Cairo on my own, albeit only by day, and as I
                mentioned before never felt physically threatened even once.</p>
                
                <p >I used the travel company G Adventures, going on their 8-day �Budget Egypt� tour
                in October 2010. The tour started in Cairo then went on to Aswan via the Great
                Pyramids, then Luxor and ended back in Cairo.</p>
