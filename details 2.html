    <p >Egypt Travel Diary Part 2:The Pyramids and the Sphinx</p>
  
<p >Seeing the pyramids for the first time is a bit like seeing the Taj Mahal � its such a
familiar sight that when you finally see the real thing your instinctive
reaction is �yep, that�s pretty much exactly as I�d imagined it�. On a flat
desert plain the Pyramids stand silent and mysterious as they have for
thousands of years. There are three large ones and a few little baby ones built
for the Pharaohs� Queens.</p>

<p >The
tour into the interior of the Great Pyramid is a very surreal experience. If
you imagined walking through passages lit with flaming torches and past walls
covered with hieroglyphics you would be very much mistaken. The Pharaohs used
to fill their tombs with all their most prized possessions and treasures
believing these would help secure their passage into the afterlife. This meant
they also lived in a real dread of unscrupulous tomb raiders breaking into
their graves. So the Pyramids were really not meant to be accessible in any way
to visitors. They are not hollow but in fact solid inside with chambers carved
into the interior that used to hold said Pharaoh, his wife and their treasures.
The Tour consists of crawling through what is ironically called the �Robbers�
Tunnel�, a tunnel dug by grave robbers much as the Pharaohs had feared. It�s a
very small space with a rough scaffolding which you scramble over, sometimes on
all fours. As a warning I have never been claustrophobic and I felt moments of
genuine panic so confined is the space. Once you�ve started there is no turning
back for the simple reason there is no space for you to turn around and squeeze
past the person behind you so you should think about whether its a good idea
for you to do this at all. The tunnel ends in the King�s chamber which is
pretty much pitch black, musty and stinks terribly. There must be some sort of
hidden ventilation but none that is visible. Knots of tourists gather around
their guides as they point their cell phone lights around the chamber. There is
nothing to see really bar a sort of sarcophagus which at some point must have
held the remains of the King.</p>

<p >But
if your guide is good he will use this opportunity in the dark silent womb of
the Pyramid to give you all sorts of tidbits about its construction. For e.g.
the perfect symmetry of the dimensions, the precision with which the building
blocks fit together, the fact that the ratio of the perimeter to the height of
the pyramid almost exactly equals 2 Pi,&nbsp; the fact that the material used
as mortar which has held the stones in place for nearly 4000 years has yet to
be reproduced successfully. And the fact that the stepped, brown exterior of
the Pyramids that we see now used to be covered with a smooth white casing
which makes you imagine how they must have gleamed and shimmered in the desert
sun in their heydey.</p>


<p >The
Sphinx is a slight disappointment just because it hasn�t weathered the
centuries as well as the Pyramids. The proportions are not quite as they are
depicted in paintings and postcards. I imagined the Sphinx with a towering head
and a perfectly proportionate body. But in actuality the head looks a lot
smaller, the body a lot larger and flatter, and the outstretched paws at the
front seem disproportionately long. The edifice of the body is crumbling and
the features on the face are worn. Yet as you walk along to the front and see
it in its full glory with the pyramids looming behind, it is quite a sight. The
calm, beautifully androgynous face gazes calmly into the distance � as it
patiently guards the last remaining Wonder of the Ancient World.</p>
