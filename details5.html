<p >The Karnak temple complex near Luxor was the most impressive of all the temples I
visited in terms of the sheer size and variety of its features. An avenue lined
with seated statues of some sort of mythical creature with the body of a lion
and the head of a ram leads to the main gate. The most jaw-dropping part of the
complex is the Hypostyle Hall or as it is popularly called � the Forest of
Pillars. Its a hall filled with rows of pillars totalling 134 in number. The
pillars are absolutely massive some as big as 21 metres tall and 3 metres wide.
And of course they are covered with drawings and hieroglyphics and their tops are
carved into varying designs of papyrus leaves. Some of them have faint traces
of coloured paint that have survived and they startle you into the sudden realisation
that back in the day the pillars were completely painted in vibrant colours from
top to bottom. Statues of kings and queens and carved obelisks litter the rest
of the complex.</p>

<p >We were in for a special treat when our guide bribed a guard into letting us into
a cordoned off section that was under restoration and showed us a chamber which
had its painted interior wonderfully well preserved. The walls were painted
white and the carvings and hieroglyphics on them were coloured in bright blues,
yellows, greens and reds. The skin of the kings was painted reddish-brown like
baked clay, the jewellery was painted gold with blue designs, the headdresses
were made of a ribbed, chain-like gold material, the eyes were cat-like and
lined with kohl. That�s when it hit me that all the temples and all the
carvings that I had seen till now must have once looked like this. The colours really
brought the carvings to life and I wished desperately I could have just a
fleeting glimpse of the entire civilisation as it must have once been.</p>
